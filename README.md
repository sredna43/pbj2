# Peanut Butter and Jelly VideoGame

Not sure what this will end up being, but the idea is a 
2 player platformer mini-game. Similar to others, but with
split screen and potentially wireless capabilities.

This game is currently on hold as I start a new game for the GameOff Game Jam hosted by github!
